# hybrid_quantum_gcnn

This is a sample code for the paper "A Hybrid Graph-Quantum Neural Network for 24-Hour Ahead Solar GHI Forecasting Using Chaotic PPSO and Cauchy Distribution"
To execute the files, start by running phase1.py. Once the training for Phase 1 is complete, collect the best results from the run and use them as input for phase2.py.
